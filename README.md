As our front page says, welcome! This is the repository for the Take website.
Using our simple yet elegantly designed website makes ordering easy.
![Order Screen](/screenshots/order.png)
With our whole menu to choose from, you can order anything you like from the comfort of your table. Simply select what you would like to order and enter a table number and name for us to deliver it to and our staff will be notified.

You can view, edit and cancel orders you've already made if you decide you've already had a tad too much cake already today.

Not too great at technology? Don't worry, with our website we'll tell you if you've forgotten to fill anything in and notify you when you've successfully ordered.

Our staff can see your orders remotely in order to prepare them for you without the hassle of asking them!
![Admin Order Screen](/screenshots/adminOrders.png)
Our website even lets them add new items to the menu whenever we get something new in for you to try.

To start simply click the "New Order" button at the top, this'll take you to our ordering page where you can select anything from our menu to order. Do you and your friends fancy more than one cup of tea between you? Simply select how many you want before clicking add to order. Added one too many? Simply click the item you wish to remove on the right and click remove from order. When you're ready to order enter your name and table number so we know where to find you and click order.
But wait! You forgot to order some cake for your friend, simply click the "View my Orders" button at the top of the page and type in your table number and you can see all our current orders to your table. Simply click the order you wish to edit and the edit this order button and we'll take you back to the order screen with everything filled out just as you left it. If you instead wanted to cancel your order there's a button for that too.
Staff, if you want to see the orders you need to prepare simply click the admin button at the top and then view orders. You will see a list of all the current orders and where they need to go. Click on an order to see the details.
If you need to edit the menu at all thats under the admin tab too. Simply click admin and then view products and you'll see a list of your current products. Simply click a product and delete to stop selling the product or edit the details to the right and "Edit Product" to save your changes. Need to add a new item? Type in the details and click the save as new product button.
As you can see from the screenshots the website works on all two browsers I have installed, that 100% compatibility (with tested browsers).
Using the web developer toolbar for chrome I have tested the website of Web Accessability. Although text in some of the menus is small the simple design means pages are easily readable without css, and the whole website is image free so disabling them changed nothing. The only aspect I would change if I had more time would be to increase the text size for those menus and to add more accessability features into the core menus to help those who need screen readers or other similar devices.
